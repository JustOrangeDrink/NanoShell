# NanoShell

## About a game

NanoShell is a traditional roguelike game where you play as an AI controlled shell, activated in the very depths of what seems to be an abandoned underground research facility. Try to get to the surface without becoming yet another rusting pile of scrap forgotten in these labs forever.

## About development

I began making this game to improve my understanding of JavaScript development, but it turned out that making roguelike games without any frameworks and libraries is really difficult, so i ended up building integrated game engine using html5 canvas for rendering and lots of spaghetti code for everything else.

The game is still in super early alpha version and probably will be for a very long time ~~if i dont abandon it altogether~~.

## Play the game

You can play the latest version of the game in any relatively modern browser that supports HTML5 canvas at this link:
